# 🏦 Bank Management System

### 📌 Overview
This project is a **Bank Management System** developed as a semester project using **C++**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and **Data Structures**.  
It simulates basic banking operations with persistent data storage in CSV files.

### ⚙️ Features
- Create a new account  
- Check account details  
- Update account information (e.g., change name)  
- Deposit cash  
- Withdraw cash  
- Delete account  
- Prevent duplicate account numbers  
- Manager can view all accounts (top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top)  
- Data stored in **CSV files** for persistence  

### 🛠️ Implementation
- Language: **C++**  
- Data Structure: **Doubly Linked List**  
- Files:
  - `src/Code.cpp` → main program source code  
  - `data/Accounts.csv` → stores account records  
  - `.gitignore` → ignored files configuration  
  - `.gitattributes` → repository attributes  

### 🚀 How It Works
- Program reads all data at runtime from `Accounts.csv`  
- Updates continuously as operations are performed  
- Includes a **clear function** for user-friendly interaction
